# I. What is Zed? üßê

> Zed is a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI.

Zed Editor is a code editor that supports real-time collaboration, developed by Nathan Sobo, who was previously known for creating the Atom text editor while working at GitHub. Built with Rust at its core, Zed is designed for "high performance" üòÆ, excelling in areas such as input latency, startup time, and memory usage.

Zed Editor enters the scene with a fresh visual appeal, aiming to provide developers with an efficient, smooth, and intuitive üëç programming environment.

> Founder Nathan's Views in the Interview üí≠:
>
> "My dream tool needs to be both powerful and have a sleek, minimalist appearance, and it must run incredibly fast. However, achieving both ultra-fast speed and powerful functionality is challenging. I can say that most of my career has been spent trying to combine these two aspects, which is precisely Zed's goal. At the same time, we tend to adhere to minimalism in user experience."
>
> "I don't want to replace the command line experience with buttons; that doesn't make sense to me. I like being close to the machine, communicating with it in a language-like manner. I hope the IDE can recognize the existence of the terminal and command line and integrate them cleanly, rather than trying to define everything in a visual interface. As a natural extension and complement to the Unix philosophy, I think this suits me better. However, if I can run tests with a shortcut key instead of switching to the terminal, pressing the up arrow, and then Enter, I would gladly accept it. But I don't want it to hide the essence, because it's essentially running a command."
>
> "My goal has always been to create a lightweight, minimalist product that feels like a text editor but has the powerful features of an IDE, avoiding the laggy experience and bulky UI. This is what I wanted from the very beginning, and it should also be extensible."

# II. Why Choose Zed? üòé

## 1. Fast ‚ö°

Zed Editor's lightweight design enables quick startup, making it an ideal choice for efficiency-focused developers. It emphasizes simplicity, focusing on speed and optimized resource usage, ensuring easy adoption without complex configurations. At the same time, it offers extensive customization options to meet the advanced needs of power users.

## 2. Intelligent üíª

Zed Editor integrates AI-assisted coding features, enhancing the development experience by making it smarter and more efficient. Whether it's code completion, error detection, or automated refactoring, AI supports you at every step of your coding process. This intelligent assistance not only speeds up development but also reduces errors and repetitive tasks in manual coding.

## 3. Collaborative üì∂

Zed Editor's most modern feature is its support for team collaboration. By using Channels and CRDTs, it allows multiple developers to work on the same file simultaneously, facilitating real-time communication and collaboration within the development team.

# III. How to Use Zed? üòâ

## 1. Quick Start üìù

Zed Editor currently supports MacOS and Linux systems, with official Windows support coming soon! On Mac, Zed supports versions from Catalina (10.15) to Sonoma (14.x). For Linux, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies‚Äîcheck out the [System Requirements - Zed](https://zed.dev/docs/system-requirements) for more details.

üëâ [Install Zed on Linux](https://zed.dev/docs/linux)

üëâ [Install Zed on Mac](https://zed.dev/docs/getting-started)

The official Windows version of Zed Editor hasn't been released yet.

However, there are a few ways to use Zed on Windows:

1. Compile it yourself or use a precompiled version from others.
2. Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run the Linux version of Zed Editor within WSL.

## 2. Custom Configuration ‚úçÔ∏è

üëâ Official Guide: [Configuring Zed - Zed](https://zed.dev/docs/configuring-zed)

üëâ Default Settings: [zed/assets/settings/default.json](https://github.com/pjlast/zed/blob/3273f5e4041f67b6703c07a14a1a106c03e36962/assets/settings/default.json)

To open the `settings.json` file, you have two options:

1. Use the shortcut `Ctrl ,`
2. Open the command palette with `Ctrl Shift P` and type `zed: open settings` to open the `settings.json` file

### Vim Mode

Zed Editor has built-in support for Vim mode. To enable it, add `"vim_mode": true,` to the `settings.json` file.

### Proxy

To set up a proxy, add `"proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:7890",` to the `settings.json` file. This will facilitate the use of Zed AI. After making changes, close and restart Zed Editor to apply the new proxy settings.

### Theme Configuration

üëâ Explore different themes: [Zed themes](https://zedz.dev/themes)

1. You can preview built-in themes via the `Theme` option in the dropdown menu under your avatar in the top-right corner.
2. To install theme plugins, go to `Extension` under the same menu. For instance, you can install the `base16` plugin and select the `snazzy` theme.
3. To customize themes, place a theme JSON file (like `zedspace.json` from [GitHub - Brunowilliang/zedspace](https://github.com/Brunowilliang/zedspace)) under `.config/zed/themes/`. Then, add the following to your `settings.json` file:

```json
// Change the theme name
"theme": {
    "mode": "dark",
    "light": "One Light",
    "dark": "ZedSpace Dark Theme"

- The built-in `vim-surround` plugin allows you to modify or remove surrounding characters like single or double quotes:

```
ds<existing>
cs<existing><desired>

# Remove the following []
[1, 2, 3] -> ds[

# Change the following [] to ()
[1, 2, 3] -> cs[(
```

- The built-in `vim-commentary` plugin enables toggling comments in visual mode with `gc` and in normal mode with `gcc`.
- The built-in `netrw` plugin supports most keybindings in the project panel.

# V. Collaboration üí•

> "The ideal collaborative environment should cover the entire lifecycle of code development." ‚Äî Founder Nathan

Collaboration has always been a key part of Zed Editor‚Äôs vision. From the very beginning, Zed Editor was built with CRDTs and text collaborative editing capabilities. Coding is no longer a solitary task but a creative, thought-provoking process.

In the past, collaboration relied on GitHub, screen sharing, communication software, etc., but these methods disrupt your workflow. The ideal collaboration should always happen within the code editor, where all actions are centralized.

üëâ [Channels - Zed](https://zed.dev/docs/channels)

üëâ [Collaboration - Zed](https://zed.dev/docs/collaboration)

> GitHub‚Äôs collaboration mode feels like sending emails; it‚Äôs an asynchronous information flow, which works well in some cases, so it remains a crucial collaboration method.

# VI. Plugin Marketplace üîå

> "I would rather have a faster, less extensible Zed than let it become a bloated system." ‚Äî Founder Nathan

The Plugin Marketplace offers a wide range of plugins designed to extend the editor's functionality to meet the needs of different developers.

You can install the necessary plugins through the `Extension` option in the dropdown menu under your avatar in the top right corner, or by using the custom shortcut `Ctrl Shift X`!

Zed Editor extensions are compiled into WebAssembly (WASM). This design choice enhances performance and security while ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
